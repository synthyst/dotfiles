# Syndot & Synvim

**An advanced, opinionated, and performance-focused dotfiles setup for Termux.**

This repository contains the configuration files for **Syndot**, a comprehensive command-line environment, and **Synvim**, a highly customized Neovim setup. The entire system is designed to provide a modern, efficient, and visually appealing experience on Android devices using Termux.

*NOTE: This project is still in its alpha stages. There may be inconsistencies and problems. Contributions are welcome!*

## Features

-   **Modern Shell**: A powerful Zsh setup with live autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and fzf-powered tab completion.
-   **Efficient Workflow**: A modal, mnemonic-driven keybinding system for both the shell (Zellij) and the editor (Neovim).
-   **Beautiful UI**: A clean, modern, and transparent aesthetic across all tools, with a custom theme switcher.
-   **Integrated Tooling**: A curated set of command-line tools for file management, searching, and system information.
-   **Powerful Neovim**: A fast, lazy-loaded Neovim configuration with deep LSP integration, advanced navigation, and a focus on user experience.
